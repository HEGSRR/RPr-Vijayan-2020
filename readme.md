## Abstract

Vijayan et al. (2020) examined whether spatial patterns existed in SARS-CoV-2 age-adjusted testing rates, age-adjusted diagnosis rates, and crude positivity rates in Los Angeles County (LAC), and used a spatial regression model to explore associations between COVID-19 crude positivity rates and a series of predictor variables. The original analyses are retrospective and use observational data collected from federal and private sources. Although not publicly available, we were able to obtain the original study data after contacting the authors. However, the analysis code was not made available, nor was information about the computational environment used.
